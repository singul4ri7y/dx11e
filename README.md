<h1 align="center">DirectX 11 & C++ Game Engine (Incomplete)</h1>
<p><b>Disclaimer: <i>This project is incomplete and it is highly unlikely that I am going to work on this project anymore, because of change in interest. It is just a past repo. that I worked on when I was into Game Dev.</i></b></p>

## Why this project:
This is a Game Engine project I worked on when I was doing Game Development back in 2020 using C++ and DirectX. This repository is incomplete, it holds just the bare bone minimum of a Game Engine framework and a little bit Graphics Development. Check **Demonstration** folder for demonstrations.

## Some insights: 
This project is divided into 2 subprojects, one of them is the library containing the main Game Engine and other functionalities regarding input, gfx etc. The other project is the client project which will use the Game Engine library, call the library functions and start taking inputs, gfx rendering and voila, you have a fully working game (well that's won't be the case for this project, sadly).

## How to build: 
Just run one of the bash scripts, both are 64-bits.
### Prerequisites: 
- `TDM GCC` or `Cygwin` or any other Windows compliant GCC compilers which have DirectX runtime libraries.
- DirectX 11 compatible GPU (Cause I used feature level upto 11).
- Have support for GNU Make.

You can check another project of mine, which compiles High-Level Shading Language (HLSL) shaders used by DirectX [here](https://github.com/signul4ri7y/hlslc).
